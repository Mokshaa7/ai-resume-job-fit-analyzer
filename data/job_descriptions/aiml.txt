Technource is hiring a skilled AI/ML Engineer to build and deploy advanced machine learning and deep learning solutions across real-world systems. The ideal candidate will have hands-on experience with the full model lifecycle, be capable of working on face and object recognition, and integrate models into high-performance, real-time applications.

Describe Skill and Experience

Design, develop, and deploy ML/DL models for classification, regression, clustering, recommendation, and real-time applications.
Manage end-to-end model lifecycle: data preparation, preprocessing, augmentation, training, validation, deployment, and monitoring.
Build and optimize RAG-based architectures by integrating LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA) with vector databases and external data sources.
Develop and deploy accurate face recognition systems (e.g., FaceNet, ArcFace) and object detection with liveness detection.
Prepare custom datasets, apply data augmentation, and validate models for robustness and accuracy.
Deploy models using REST APIs, Docker, Kubernetes, and MLOps tools for scalable, production-grade solutions.
Ensure real-time performance of AI models in production systems, including edge deployment when required.
Strong skills in Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and either PyTorch or TensorFlow.
Excellent debugging, optimization, and problem-solving skills on real-world datasets.
Familiarity with model optimization techniques and performance scaling is a plus.
